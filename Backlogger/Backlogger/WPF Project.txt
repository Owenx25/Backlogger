Design Ideas for the Application
=================================
- Tabs at the top of the window show which category is selected
	- Backlog categories would be things like games, movies, hows, books, etc.
	- The User can add number of categories with their own titles and descriptions
	- User starts with a few basic columns like 
- Reminder system where you can set recurring reminders for each item on a tab
- User can add their own custom columns in each tab
- Drag items in a tab to reorder(might want to use a framwork for this)

Backend Brainstorm
===================
- The application uses a list of Table objects
- Each table object contains Name, Add Date, Priority and Notes
	- This can be toggled in settings except for Name
	- Add date is generated at the creation of the object
		- Date format option?
	- Within a table object is a list of Columns
		- Columns are entirely user created
		- always strings but user has to choose data type on creation
			- May be anble to do some tricky WPF stuff with this
